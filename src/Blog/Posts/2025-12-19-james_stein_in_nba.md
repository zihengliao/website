Let's set the stage for some context first.

Picture this. It's 2003 you and your mate are arguing about how this is the best draft class since the 1996 draft featuring Kobe Bryant and the like. There are multiple metrics to decide how good players are, but you decide to look at free throws due to its simplicity self paced nature ie. there are no external factors influencing you performing this skill.

Currently there have only been 10 games into the season, but you start looking at FT% (free throw %) across every player in the draft since you don't want to wait until the end of the season to prove a point. 

You take a look, and Lebron is currently a 61% FT shooter, Carmelo Anthony is at 72% and Dwayne Wade is at 67% etc. 

However because it's only 10 games into the season, you know this is an inaccurate estimate of their true FT%.

I'm going to go on a quick tangent here so please bare with me. In the 1950s and prior to that, statistician believed that unbiasedness was the best way to model data and make predictions. So the Lebron's 61% FT accuracy is calculated by dividing the amount of free throws he has made (23) by the amount of free throws he has attempted (38). You can see how this is unbiased since we are only using the data of what Lebron has shown us.

In 1956, Charles Stein proved that being unbiased under certain scenarios was not the best way to make predictions, a result later refined by Willard James and Charles Stein in 1961.
